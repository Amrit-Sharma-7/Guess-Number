# Guess a Number

A simple web application where the computer generates a random number and the user has to guess it within 10 tries. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to help practice core JavaScript concepts such as random number generation, event handling, and conditional logic.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation**: The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- **Guessing Attempts**: The user has 10 tries to guess the number.
- **Feedback**: Provides hints whether the guess is higher or lower than the generated number.
- **Game Over**: If the user exhausts the 10 attempts, the input is disabled and a prompt to start a new game is displayed.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure the web page.
- **CSS**: Style the web page.
- **JavaScript**: Implement the game logic and handle user interactions.

## Project Structure

```plaintext
guess-a-number/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── main.js
```

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure for the guessing game.
- **styles.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the guessing game.
- **main.js**: Contains the JavaScript code for the game logic.

## Key JavaScript Concepts Practiced

- **Random Number Generation**: Use `Math.random()` to generate a random number.
- **Event Handling**: Respond to user inputs and button clicks.
- **Conditional Logic**: Implement game rules to check guesses and provide feedback.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Update HTML elements to reflect game state and user feedback.
- **Form Handling**: Manage user input and validate the number of attempts.

## Acknowledgments

- This project was created to practice JavaScript concepts and improve web development skills.
